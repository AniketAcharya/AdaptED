export const initTrans = `Guys, in today's video we'll see class objects in JavaScript. So that you have no problems using them, we'll go through them in depth. Let's get to our computer screen's and get started. So guys we have seen so many things in object oriented programming, We are going to take our knowledge a long way ahead, and I'll type classes and objects. I have opened this repl in a new tab. and we'll type all of our code in script.js, so Let's see in our notes how we perform this in JavaScript. We'll do it practically in this video. In object oriented programming a class is an extensible program code template for creating objects providing initial values for state member variables, and implementation of behavior method functions. I know you don't get it, but I got it covered. In object-oriented programming, This is a definition of classes and objects from Wikipedia. Assume that you go to a railway station and ask for reservation form. As you have asked for it, they provide you the reservation form. If someone else comes and asks for a reservation form, they will provide him with the same copy that they gave you. Because that form is a template, it can be printed for 1000s of people. It has been provided to the station office and the office has been advised that whoever comes, give this form to them and they'll submit it for whichever train they want that goes to their destination. Now, if you have never travelled in general, let me tell you that you just need a ticket to travel. We are talking about the ones for which we need reservation, today we can reserve online. What I want to point here is that Class is a template, just like that blank form. Now what are objects? When you type your name, let's assume you typed Ritesh Yadav. age is 23 years old. You insisted on sitting in the upper birth. You wanted ticket in 2nd ac. So you filled it out this way and submitted it with the money. It is an object. By using a template, it made an object. Now no one else can use that form as you typed your name, Ritesh Yadav, in it. No one else can use it. So the class was a template, and if it was missing, you might have had issues. filling the form. If I gave you blank paper instead of a form, you'd have trouble writing it. You don't know where to put your name or your address? That's why templates like classes were formed. Now you fill it the way you want and it will become an object. 1000's of people are using this template to reserve their trains. It has become a generic form. If you want to travel in Shatabadi, you fill it out. If you want to travel in 2nd class, or if you want to travel in a sleeper on your way to the capital, fill in this form. So you get the point here that you can use this form for anywhere and however you want to go. I'm not endorsing any particular train; I simply used it as an example. Class is an template. "Class Object" And an object is an entity that derives from the class. OK, It's an entity. So let's type it's code. What's the syntax? You type in class and fill it in this way. So type class and RailwayForm I'll simply fill it out and put my methods here. We'll talk about what constructors are. I'll put it as it is, which is not even necessary. Some methods like submit, I'll type alert("form submitted"). OK? And I can type another method here let's take cancel. I'll again type alert, this form is cancelled. For simplicity, I type "submit" with an alert. and if I want to cancel, I can do that. Now let's say 2 people want to travel. One is Harry. He demands a form, which he has been provided. Assume that if it happened online, everyone would receive a pdf copy of the same form. You all agree with me. Because everyone would be getting a copy of the same file, When we type a new form, we will inherit from the same file. The same scenario is here. Now let's say Rohan also wants to travel. He'll get the same form. let harry = new railway form let rohan = new railway form. Assume they both joyfully submit their forms. So harry and rohan both submitted. Let's say Rohan doesn't want to go. So he would have to cancel the form. Form will be submitted twice and will be cancelled once. We'll see that here. Let me reload and "Form submitted" appears, form submitted, Because of the wrong spelling of "cancel", "form cancelled" did not appear. Let's reload and take a look at the console if there's an error. It'll be submitted twice and cancelled once. Let's look at console. Rohan.cancel is not a function was coming. But not this form is cancelled appears. So in real world we model classes like this. Modelling classes are like making a game. In the game, there will be a player class, and in that class, the things that the player can do will be stored. By doing this, our ability to understand the code increases or code readability increases. If I give you a random code that has 4-5 functions, You might not be able to understand that. But if a class have straight forward methods in it, Like here just by reading I understand that harry has submitted his form. and if I put harry form instead of it, So it's understandable that Harry's form has been submitted. I changed it from railway form to Harry's form. And after filling it, I can do one more thing. Let's say I type harryform.fill and in this I want to type my name. And I make a fill method which takes name. Got it? I type name here "this.name = name". Now you'll ask what did you do. And while cancelling it, I typed alert{name + "this form is cancelled"} So if I make Harry's form and Rohan's form too, I'll tell you everything so that you won't face any problems. You don't know what "this" is. You don't understand it. Don't worry. I'll tell you what "this" is. When I filled out the form, I made a fillmethod. The method takes a name. "this.name" means that this object's property is name, so fill it in. Let me change its name so that no confusion occurs. I put the same "name" for both the property and the fill. So I'll change it to "givenname". What did you give? Name. A property(name) will be associated with this, which is named Harry. So whenever I print its name, I'll get it. I'll have to type "this.name" instead of "name". So when I run this.name, Harry, this form will be cancelled. So let's run it and we'll learn more about it afterwards. Rohan is not defined, it appears. And Rohan is not defined. Where are you Rohan... And I know that you don't understand what's happening. Don't worry, I'll tell you throughout this video. Form submitted form submitted. Rohan, This form is cancelled. It appears OK, So what did I do. Create a form for harry. Ok. One form is provided by Railway officers. They gave you a form. Only the things that you need to write down are mentioned there. Now I type, fill the form with details I'm doing the same thing for Rohan. I can make an array of forms too. But I won't get into that complex right now. OK, so fill in the form with Rohan's details. So I'll type Rohan here. Rohan's Details OK, And we put this here, so when we submit harryform.submit, I can do that here too. this.name + Your form is submitted. So what'll happen? Let's say for Rohan, Rohan will print. Because I saved the name with fill. Rohan, your form is submitted. And here, Rohan, your form is cancelled, will come, and for Harry, your form is cancelled, will come. So when I put harryform.submit in, it will submit. When I put rohanform.submit, this method will run. It can be for anyone of them that I run. And as I'm just cancelling the form for Rohan only, the cancel method will run for Rohan only. And now I'll run it to show you that the name will come as Harry came here. Rohan came too, for both cancellation and submission. This form is cancelled, it appears. So like this, I can associate properties with individual objects. I can put Harry as the name for this object and Rohan for this one. Let's say I decided to give them train numbers too. I want to give train no. 143 143416 is the train number with which I want to travel. Harry wants to travel like this. And Rohan wants to travel with the 12222 train, just so you remember. This is the name of the train, a very unique train. And let me put 420 at the end so we remember. After doing this, When I run the fill method, I put a name and a number. So I need to put trainno for it to acceptit. "this.trainno = trainno" I'm assigning both these variables the same. Why? Because I want to tell you that we can assign them the same. It's not like I'm putting "name" here and "givenname" here. I'm just telling you that "givenname" is what appears, And this.name is the property I made for it. Simmilarly, "trainno" is what appears and "this.trainno" is the property for it. They both have the same name, and they can have No worries there. Now I'll type that along with the "formsubmitted" and "form cancelled" alerts for Harry. I'll assign them "trainname". And if you guys... If you want to fill this string perfectly,you can also use template literals, the one I told you that's made with the help of backtick. Filling variables can be done by putting $ in the backtick. But I'm not doing that here as everything is already here. Now if I run it. Harry your form is submitted for train number 145316 and Rohan your form is submited for this one. And Rohan your form is cancelled for trainnumber this appears. Now let's say Rohan booked twice so that, he can travel by whichever train he likes. So Rohan will have 2 forms, form1 and form2. We can do such things as well. And we will fill out the other form with train number 9211. Now he just wants to cancel the train with number 420. How will we do that? We made 2 different objects, so we'll type rohanform(1) as it has a train with number 420. And we'll submit rohanform(1) as well as(2). And we'll cancel rohanform(1) just like that. So we can make multiple forms, multiblevariables, as much as we want, and let me change it to 2. And let me put two here too. So now it's perfect. Now let me save it. Replit takes some time to save. After reload your form is submitted appears. and train numbers 420 and 911 appear too. And an alert comes for Rohan as he has cancelled one train. So I hope that you understand object oriented programming In the next video we'll talk about constructors, and we'll continue with this example so we see how constructors make things a little easier. And we'll discuss why we should use constructors. It's all for this video. If you haven't accessed the playlist, please kindly do so. Thank you so much, guys, for watching this video, and I'll see you next time.`;

JavaScript Classes

❮ Previous
Next ❯


ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced JavaScript Classes.
JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects.

JavaScript Class Syntax
Use the keyword class to create a class.
Always add a method named constructor():

Syntax

class ClassName {
   constructor() { ... }
}



Example

class Car {
   constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
}


The example above creates a class named "Car".
The class has two initial properties: "name" and "year".

A JavaScript class is not an object.
It is a template for JavaScript objects.


Using a Class
When you have a class, you can use the class to create objects:

Example

const myCar1 = new Car("Ford", 2014);
const myCar2 = new Car("Audi", 2019);


Try it Yourself »


The example above uses the Car class to create two Car objects.

The constructor method is called automatically when a new object is created.


The Constructor Method
The constructor method is a special method:

It has to have the exact name "constructor"
It is executed automatically when a new object is created
It is used to initialize object properties

If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript 
will add an empty constructor method.








Class Methods
Class methods are created with the same syntax as object methods.
Use the keyword class to create a class.
Always add a constructor() method.
Then add any number of methods.

Syntax

class ClassName {
   constructor() { ... }
  method_1() { ... }
  method_2() { ... }
  method_3() { ... }
}


Create a Class method named "age", that returns the Car age:

Example

class Car {
   constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
   }  age() {
    const date = new Date();
    return date.getFullYear() - this.year;
   }}
const myCar = new Car("Ford", 2014);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"My car is " + myCar.age() + " years old.";


Try it Yourself »


You can send parameters to Class methods:

Example

class Car {  constructor(name, year) {    
  this.name = name;    this.year = year;  }  
  age(x) {    return x - this.year;  }}
  const date = new Date();
  let year = date.getFullYear();const myCar = new 
  Car("Ford", 2014);document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="My car is 
  " + myCar.age(year) + " years old."; 

Try it Yourself »

Classes in JavaScript: 










Chrome 49
Edge 12
